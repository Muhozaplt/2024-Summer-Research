The file ID_text_file.ipynb contain Python code on the method of sorting the ZFOURGE data and genarates a text file containing the sorted galaxy IDs.

These galaxies are then uploaded to [CEGALE](https://cigale.lam.fr/) software to produce AGN lumunosity of these galaxies. 
Data given by CEGALE is then used to investigate the impact of AGN contamination on the UVJ colour-colour diagram. The full analysis of this can be found in project_data_analysis.ipynb file.
